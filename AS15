Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.
Database : an organized collection of data and information or interrelated data collected at one place.

SQL	(~) vs NoSQL(*)
~RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)	
*Non-relational or distributed database system.

~These databases have fixed or static orpredefined schema	
*They have dynamic schema

~These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.	
*These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.

~These databases are best suited for complex queries	
*These databases are not so good for complex queries

~Vertically Scalable	
*Horizontally scalable

~Follows ACID property	
*Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)

~Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, etc	
*Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.
 DDL- DDL stands for data difinition language. DDL commands helps define database schema.
 
Query statements are DDL, that define databases, tables & table structures (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE) or manage database & table (ALTER DATABASE, DROP DATABASE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

DDL basically defines the column of the table. DML is used to create database schema

# CREATE- Create commands is used to create database and object in SQL.
             e.g.- CREATE DATABASE db1;
                   CREATE TABLE student;
# DROP- DROP commands is used to delete existing SQL database.
             e.g.- DROP TABLE student ;
# ALTER- ALTER commands is used to add,delete,or modify column in existing column.
             e.g.- ALTER TABLE student ADD c1,c1,c3;
                   ALTER TABLE student DROP c3;
# TRUNCATE - remove all rows from the table, but the structure of the table still exists.
             e.g-TRUNCATE TABLE Student_info;

Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.
Data Manipulation Language (DML) can be defined as a set of syntax elements that are used to manage the data in the database. The commands of DML are not auto-committed and modification made by them are not permanent to the database. It is a computer programming language that is used to perform select, insert, delete and update data in a database. The user requests are assisted by Data Manipulation Language. This language is responsible for all forms of data modification in a database.

#Insert 
Using this command, the programmers can insert values into the rows of a table. The general syntax for this command is mentioned below:
Insert into Table_Name
(column1, column2, column3….. columnN) Values ( value1, value2, value3….. valueN)

#update
The values of columns in a table can be modified or updated by using this command. The general syntax for this command is mentioned below:
UPDATE tutorialspoint SET Author= “webmaster” Where Author= “anonymous”

#Delete
The programmers can remove one or more rows from a table by using this command. The general syntax of this command is mentioned below:
DELETE FROM table_name (Where Condition);

Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.
DQL stands for Data Query Language, DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.
SELECT - shows the records of the specified table
SELECT * FROM Student;

Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.
PRIMARY KEY
A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence. 

Example: Refer the figure – 
STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE both, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen as the primary key (only one out of many candidate keys). 

FOREIGN KEY: 
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 

Example: Refer the figure – 
STUD_NO in STUDENT_COURSE is a foreign key to STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.

Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.
#CURSOR() METHOD
It is an object that is used to make the connection for executing SQL queries. It acts as middleware between SQLite database connection and SQL query. It is created after giving connection to SQLite database.

Syntax: cursor_object=connection_object.execute(“sql query”);

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import mysql.connector
# import mysql.connector
#create user 'user'@'%' identified by 'password'
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="abc",
  password="password"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("select * from test1.test_table")
for i in mycursor.fetchall():
    print(i)

mydb.close()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#Execute method()- The execute command is used to execute a stored procedure.Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.

Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
The order in which the clauses in queries are executed is as follows:
    1. FROM/JOIN: The FROM and/or JOIN clauses are executed first to determine the data of interest.
    2. WHERE: The WHERE clause is executed to filter out records that do not meet the constraints.
    3. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is executed to group the data based on the values in one or more columns.
    4. HAVING: The HAVING clause is executed to remove the created grouped records that don’t meet the constraints.
    5. SELECT: The SELECT clause is executed to derive all desired columns and expressions.
    6. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is executed to sort the derived values in ascending or descending order.
    7. LIMIT/OFFSET: Finally, the LIMIT and/or OFFSET clauses are executed to keep or skip a specified number of            rows.
